									<p>On August 21st, 2017, Corvallis experienced almost two full minutes of totality -- completely shrouded under a lunar shadow.</p>

									<h2>Dark Skies on a Sunny Day</h2>
									
										
									<p>One year before the big event, I sat hunched over my computer frantically clicking "refresh" on the recreation.gov website. A few friends and I tried desperately to score a 25-person campsite in the path of totality. The website crashed for half an hour, and we came away with limited options. Ultimately I chose to enjoy the event in the comfort of my own backyard in Corvallis.</p>

									<p>Well, not quite my backyard. We biked and hiked up to the top of Chip Ross Park for an elevated vantage point. Reaching the top around 9:30 am, a small crowd had formed. This was definitely the type of experience that is best shared amongst a large group.</p>

									<p>As 10:17 am approached, the skies began to darken with exponential speed. The temperature dropped markedly, and excitement levels skyrocketed. It was nearly time. I began filming.</p>

									<h2>Totality</h2>
									
									<p>As we passed entirely into the shadow of the moon, I was watching the bizarre shadows forming all across the ground. Unlike the crescent shaped shadows we observed earlier, these shadows looked more like dozens of thin, transparent snakes slithering in the same direction (invisible in my video). My roommate Stephen's "oh shit...!" brought my attention to the sun and moon.</p>

									<p>It's impossible to describe the beauty of the corona as it shines around the perimeter of the pitch black moon. It wasn't quite <i>white</i> light, but rather a psychedelic color that seemed to have entire rainbows condensed into curling, shifting lines. [Interestingly, this is not far from the truth -- a rainbow is simply the visible light from the sun smeared and separated into distinct bands.]</p>
									<p>The night before the eclipse, I drew my rendition of the corona on the table at Block 15. I'd say I wasn't too far off the mark!</p>
