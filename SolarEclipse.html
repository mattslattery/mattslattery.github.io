									<p>On August 21st, 2017, Corvallis experienced almost two full minutes of totality -- completely shrouded under a lunar shadow.</p>

									<h2>Dark Forecast on a Sunny Day</h2>
									
										
									<p>I early anticipated the Oregon eclipse for almost two years. Celestial events always strike an awesome and humbling chord in me. Meteor showers are high on my list of favorite natural wonders (a topic for another post), and I had no doubt that a solar eclipse would really rock my socks.</p>

									<p>We biked and hiked up to the top of Chip Ross Park for an elevated vantage point. Reaching the top around 9:30 am, a small crowd had formed. This is definitely the type of experience that's best shared amongst your fellow earthlings.</p>

									<p>As 10:17 am -- the first moment of totality -- approached, the skies began to darken with exponential speed. The temperature dropped markedly, and excitement levels skyrocketed. It was nearly time. I began filming.</p>

									<h2>Totality</h2>
									
									<p>As we passed entirely into the shadow of the moon, I was watching the bizarre shadows forming all across the ground. Unlike the crescent shaped shadows we observed earlier, these shadows looked more like dozens of thin, transparent snakes slithering in the same direction (invisible in my video). My roommate Stephen's "oh shit...!" brought my attention to the sun and moon.</p>

									<p>It's impossible to describe the beauty of the corona as it shines around the perimeter of the pitch black moon. It wasn't quite <i>white</i> light, but rather a psychedelic color that seemed to have entire rainbows condensed into curling, shifting lines. [Interestingly, this is not far from the truth -- a rainbow is simply the visible light from the sun smeared and separated into distinct bands.]</p>
									<p>Cool science story:</p>
									<p>In 1919, astronmers used the solar eclipse to prove Einstein's theory of general relativity! With most of the light blocked by the moon, you can actually see stars in the middle of the day. This is important, because the general relativity suggests that the enormous mass of the sun would warp the space-time next to it, altering the position of the incoming starlight nearby. Sure enough, the solar eclipse allowed astronomers to precisely measure the apparent position of stars adjacent to the sun, and demonstrated that it was indeed changed. Neato, eh?</p>

									<p>The night before the eclipse, I drew my rendition of the corona on the table at Block 15. I'd say I wasn't too far off the mark!</p>
